"""
HTTP server with timeout capabilities and fast shutdown.

This module provides two HTTP server classes with automatic inactivity timeout
and immediate shutdown response using threading.Event instead of polling.

Classes:
    TimeoutThreadingHTTPServer: HTTP server with configurable inactivity timeout
    SSLTimeoutThreadingServer: SSL/TLS-enabled version of the timeout server
